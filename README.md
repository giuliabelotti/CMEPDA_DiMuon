# Forward-backward asymmetry of Drell-Yan events at 13 TeV 

The goal of this analysis is reproduce the forward-backward asymmetry of Drell-Yan events in pp collisions using CMS Open Data at 13 TeV, according to the results presented by CMS Collaboration in the article [arXiv:1806.00863v2 [hep-ex]](https://arxiv.org/abs/1806.00863).
