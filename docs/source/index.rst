Welcome to CMEPDA_Exam_DrellYanEvents-13TeV's documentation!
============================================================

**CMEPDA_Exam_DrellYanEvents-13TeV** is a project whose goal is reproduce the forward-backward asymmetry of Drell-Yan events in pp collisions using CMS Open Data at 13 TeV, according to the results presented by CMS Collaboration in the article `arXiv:1806.00863v2 [hep-ex] <https://arxiv.org/abs/1806.00863v2>`_.
Three analysis are provided:
* Mass distribution.
* Angle distribution.
* Forward-backward asymmetry.
    
for two di-leptons channels, muons and electrons, depending on the Z decay.
